We will be doing a hands-on practical lab on the use of GitHub, creating repositories, and managing the notifications. 
RESOURCES USED - Github URL: https://github.com/ 

- Configure github account on slack: /github subscribe githubUsername 

- Verify git is installed: git --version 

- Download Git URL: https://git-scm.com/downloads 

- Command to get all configuration: git config --list --show-origin 

- Command to configure username: git config --global user.name "yourUsernameforGithub" 

- Command to configure username: git config --global user.email "yourEmailAddressforGithub" 

– To clone a repository: git clone 

- To push your code back to github, do + git add . and press enter key 

Note: "The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. 
However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant way—changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit ." + git status and press enter key 

Note: "The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. 

The status output does not show you any information regarding the committed project history". + git commit -m "commit message" and press enter key 

Note: 'The git commit command is used to move files from the staging area to a commit. This command is run after git add, which is used to add files to the staging area. git commit creates a snapshot of the changes made to a Git repository which can then be pushed to the main repository when the developer is ready to do so". + git push and press enter key 
Note: "The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. ... Remote branches are configured using the git remote command. Pushing has the potential to overwrite changes, caution should be taken when pushing."
